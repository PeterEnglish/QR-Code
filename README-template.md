## My process
I started with the blank template given by FrontendMentor.io. First of all, I added the provide image through the use of an image tag, so as to have all the elements I needed on the page.

My second step was to wrap all the component parts in a div to create a flex-column layout.

Last of all, I added font-weights, margins and paddings to achieve the desired effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I re-capped what I already knew about flexbox. I used both 'justify-content' and 'align-items' to center the contents of the container div. Because this div had no set width and height, it could expand to fit its contents.

```css
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
```

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on CSS Grid, not because I find it
amazingly effective, but just because I have more experience with it than with Flexbox
